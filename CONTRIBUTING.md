# How to contribute to Time Slots Finder

First of all, thank you for your interest in this package !

Every suggestion, advice, or comment about this project, as long as it's done in a
benevolent way, will be much appreciated.

## General considerations

If you're new to GitHub open source contributions through Pull Requests, this may help you: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Every Pull Request submitted **must have passed all the checks**. This means that your work must **contain unit tests** and **follow the code style** enforced by ESLint and the `.eslintrc` files of this package.

The [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) may help you with unit testing. If an ESLint rule seams unclear to you, you can find its definition in the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

_If you still have a hard time with the testing part, feel free to ask question through the comments of your Pull Request (tagging us may help getting notified about your question, see our username below)._

The maintainers of this package are **@percypyan**, **@fbeiger** and **@Juskie**.
